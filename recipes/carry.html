        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, or more to taste</li> 
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li> 
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li> 
                <li>5 ⅓ cups water, divided</li> 
                <li>1 (7.75 ounce) package curry sauce mix (such as S&B® Golden Curry®)</li> 
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li> 
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li> 
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms</li> 
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li> 
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li> 
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice (such as Mahatma®)</li> 
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and 
                    season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the
                    pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center 
                    and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. 
                    Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave 
                    on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry 
                    sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, 
                    then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to 
                    medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 
                    20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
